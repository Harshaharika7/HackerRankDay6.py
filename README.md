# HackerRank 30 Days of Code - Day 6: Operators, Strings, and Loops

## 🧠 Objective

Today, we expand our understanding of strings and indexing by using loops and string slicing.


## 📝 Task

Given a string `S`, split it into two new strings:

- One containing the **even-indexed characters**
  
- One containing the **odd-indexed characters**

Then print both strings on one line separated by a space.


## 🔢 Input Format

- The first line contains an integer `T` (number of test cases).
  
- The next `T` lines each contain a string `S`.


## 📌 Constraints

- `1 ≤ T ≤ 10`
- `2 ≤ len(S) ≤ 10,000`
